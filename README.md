# Corne Encoded

A spinoff (pun intended) of Corne v2.2. It has the following changes
made to it from the original (description below):
- Added rotary encoder support
- Battery switch and terminals
- Changed end thumb key to 1.25u
- Repositioned mounting holes of microcontroller protective plate
- Visual changes

This project is still a WIP and the silkscreen is rather confusing.
In order to use a wired version with rotary encoder, it would be required
to mount the TRRS Jack underneath or to put the encoder on top of it.
The rotary encoder's side legs must be snapped off to fit flush with the PCB.

Projects refrenced: Klor, Ferris Sweep, Corne v2.2
